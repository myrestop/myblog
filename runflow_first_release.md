## We are happy to announce the first release of RunFlow, the new powerful efficiency tool

**RunFlow** is a cross-platform productivity tool, that similar to [Wox](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox) and [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) on Windows, and also similar like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) and [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) on macOS. But we have differences with these tools, and we have our own unique new features. Right now, at the below, we will introduce you what features of RunFlow have been implemented in more detail. It's an amazing journey, let's start.

#### Cross Platform

The first main feature is cross-platform. Let you have a unified UI and operation experience when working cross-platform, do not need to switch tools.

> But Unfortunately for Linux users, the first edition of RunFlow have some fatal problems on Linux, so, currently, Linux is not supported yet. But we will try more efforts to fix these problems to make RunFlow working fine on Linux, and Linux will get support eventually.

#### Multiple Languages

RunFlow support multiple languages, but by default, we only have english and simplified chinese. If you prefer to other languages, you can go to our [plugin store](https://myrest.top/store/plugin?query=language) to find a language translator, after you installed the plugin, you can choose your preferred language.

#### Customizable Style and Theme

Here we want to introduce you one of our design philosophy is that we allow user to highly customize most thing, so we allow plugin to provide one or more window style and theme, to let you choose what you preferred.
